# The Catster's .doom.d
After almost a year of using my own Emacs configuration, I've learned
more than I had ever expected to. That's great, but more often than not
I just want to get work done.

I'm attempting to use Doom from now on to relieve the hours spent on
minor corrections I wanted, since 90% of them are here (and I can still use vanilla Emacs keybindings).
